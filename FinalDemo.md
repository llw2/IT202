# Final Demo: Project Showcase
This is your final presentation assignment (there is no final exam)
<br>
You will record a demo of your application base on all of the milestones covered

## Objective

* Present your app as if you were showing a friend, family member, interviewer, etc.
* Start from the registration process and explore your app as a user
<ul>

* You may log in later as an admin or elevated user if you need
</ul>

* Talk about each screen/action you're presenting (briefly explain what's happening in the background funtionality wise)
<ul>

* You may use your proposal as a guideline but you do not need to go through it line item by line item<br>
* Explain at a high level how it works to demonstrate you understand the fullstack of the architecture
</ul>

* You may show the database results after actions if you wish to show supporting evidence
* Attempt to keep the demo under 30 minutes, although this is not a hard maximum
<ul>

* There is no minimum as long as it covers what you intend to have credited
</ul>

* Upload the video (https://youtube.com)

<ul>

* I would **prefer** it if you would use your NJIT account and ensure the video is marked as unlisted or public)<br>
* __IMPORTANT:__ You will need to verify your account to allow recordings greater than 15 minutes otherwwise they will be rejected
</ul>

* ```Edit your proposal.md```

<ul>

* ```Include links to each of your milestone.md files```

</ul>

* If a feature isn't working highlight it in the video, explain what you tried and why you think it is not working along with any supporting details
* If you missed a feature in a previous milestone you may highlight that as well
* You don't need to show yourself in the video but you can if you want to
* Voice is required

## Ways to capture the recording

* [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-a-presentation-as-a-video%E2%80%8B-in-powerpoint-ba919059-523d-40a8-b99c-08d18996c09d) instructional video
* [Windows Game Recorder](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/record-a-game-clip-on-your-pc-with-xbox-game-bar-2f477001-54d4-1276-9144-b0416a307f3c) 
* Kaltura
* other similar recording mechanisms that do **NOT** match the following section

## What won't be accepted:

* Screen recordings captured by filming/recording your computer screen via a phone, tablet, another device
* Google drive links
* Anything that requires me to download video

## Grading:

* Grading will be based on a number of factors

<>

* Quality of demo/presentatoin (thorough explanations and walkthroughs)
* Feature Quality and Quantity of completed items
* Technical errors or unfriendly output will reduce the grade
* Lack of basic styling will reduce the grade
* Fake or Falsely implemented features will reduce the grade

<ul>

* This means you tried to fake it to look like a feature was implemented, but it was strategically hardcoded/demoed to seem like it works when in reality it does not.
* If you highlight it as a non-working feature as the **Objectives** ask, you may get partial credit instead of 0 for a particular item

</ul>

* The more effort put forward beyond what was done in class, the more of credit will be given
* Demo must be from NJIT's webserver in the prod location. The grade will be reduced it presented from localhost webserver or the dev hierarchy

</ul>

## Deliverable

* Paste the direct link to the final/latest version of your proposal.md on github from the prod branch. There will be a reduction in grade if the prod branch is not used
* Ensure the video is accessible, a video that does not load/play will get a 0 on the final demo
* Ensure the audio works on the video. Lack of audio will prevent a clear understanding of your explanations.
