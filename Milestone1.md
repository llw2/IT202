# Milestone1 Deliverable (pts. 10.00)
## Instructions
1. Checkout Milestone1 branch
2. Create a milestone1.md file in your Project folder
3. Git add/commit/push this empty file to Milestone1 (you'll need the link later)
4. Fill in the deliverable items
    - For each feature, add a direct link (or links) to the expected file the implements the
feature from NJIT webserver prod (I.e, https://web.njit.edu/~llw2/llw2-prod/Project/register.php)
5. Ensure your images display correctly in the sample markdown at the bottom
    - NOTE: You may want to try to capture as much checklist evidence in your screenshots

invalid/non-loading images)
11. Make a pull request from Milestone1 to dev and merge it (resolve any conflicts)
    - Make sure everything looks ok on heroku dev
12. Make a pull request from dev to prod (resolve any conflicts)
    - Make sure everything looks ok on heroku prod
